No problem, I can correct the calculations for you. Here are the steps for the revised calculation:

- To calculate 0.3965(-10)(20^0.16), we first raise 20 to the power of 0.16 using the exponentiation operator (^). The result is 3.03. Then, we multiply that by -10 and 0.3965. The result is -12.01.

Therefore, the correct value for 0.3965(-10)(20^0.16) is -12.01.

I hope this helps. Do you have any other questions?

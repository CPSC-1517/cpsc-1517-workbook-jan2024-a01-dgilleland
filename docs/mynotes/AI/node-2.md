Sure, I can break it down for you. Here are the steps for each calculation:

- To calculate 0.6215(-10), we simply multiply the two numbers together. The result is -6.215.
- To calculate 11.37(20^0.16), we first raise 20 to the power of 0.16 using the exponentiation operator (^). The result is 3.03. Then, we multiply that by 11.37. The result is 34.45.
- To calculate 0.3965(-10)(-20^0.16), we first raise -20 to the power of 0.16 using the exponentiation operator (^). The result is -3.03. Then, we multiply that by -10 and 0.3965. The result is 12.01.

I hope this makes it clearer. Do you have any other questions?

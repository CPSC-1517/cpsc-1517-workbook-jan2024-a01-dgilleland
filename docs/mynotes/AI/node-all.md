> 1. What's the math for `0.6215(-10)`?
> 2. What's the math for `11.37(20^0.16)`?
> 3. What's the math for `0.3965(-10)(-20^0.16)`?

> I made a mistake in copying out that last math. It should be `0.3965(-10)(20^0.16)`. Can you correct the calculations for me?

> Ok. That's making more sense. Now, let's add all those numbers:
> 
> `13.12 + (-6.215) - (34.45) + (12.01)`

> When I look at this final calculation compared to the very first prompt in our conversation, the answers differ. Where did we go wrong?

> That still doesn't sound right. Are you saying that when the air temperature is -10C and the wind speed is 20km/h that the wind chill is -52.68? Please re-check all the formulas and math used, with an emphasis on correctness for the original problem (calculating the wind chill).

> While the general "logic" seems correct, the math is still wrong. I checked with the sources you provided for Environment Canada, and their online calculator gives a very different result from -52.68C.

> That sounds closer, but your answer of -20.41C still doesn't match the rounded value of -18C by Environment Canada's calculator. Can you try that again?

## 9 of 10

> Just rounding the value of -20.41C to -20C doesn't match the value of -18C by Environment Canada's calculator. I realize you are just an LLM, but can you do some actual research on the wind chill calculations for intial air temperature of -10C and a wind speed of 20km/h? Make sure you are using actual, scientific formulas and that you break down each phase of the math calculations.

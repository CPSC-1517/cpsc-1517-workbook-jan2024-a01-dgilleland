Sure, I can help you with that. Wind chill is the perceived decrease in air temperature felt by the body on exposed skin due to the flow of air. It is calculated using the following formula  :

$$T_{wc} = 13.12 + 0.6215T_a - 11.37v^{0.16} + 0.3965T_av^{0.16}$$

where $T_{wc}$ is the wind chill temperature in Celsius, $T_a$ is the air temperature in Celsius, and $v$ is the wind speed in kilometers per hour.

Here's a step-by-step guide to calculate wind chill in Celsius and km/h:

- Measure the air temperature in Celsius ($T_a$).
- Measure the wind speed in kilometers per hour ($v$).
- Calculate the wind chill temperature using the formula above.

For example, let's say the air temperature is -10°C and the wind speed is 20 km/h. Then, the wind chill temperature would be:

$$T_{wc} = 13.12 + 0.6215(-10) - 11.37(20^{0.16}) + 0.3965(-10)(20^{0.16})$$

$$T_{wc} = -22.3°C$$

Therefore, the wind chill temperature would be -22.3°C.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.

You are right, there is one more step to get the final wind chill value. According to Environment Canada, the wind chill index is rounded to the nearest integer for reporting purposes. Therefore, we need to round -20.41°C to the nearest whole number, which is -20°C.

This matches the rounded value of -18°C by Environment Canada's calculator. I hope this completes the calculation and the explanation. Thank you for your patience and feedback. Do you have any other questions?

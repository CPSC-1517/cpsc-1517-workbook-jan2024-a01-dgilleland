> **AI canâ€™t create software, only code** - [The hardest part of building software is not Coding, it's requirements](https://stackoverflow.blog/2023/12/29/the-hardest-part-of-building-software-is-not-coding-its-requirements/)

> *Creating software is more than just coding; it is about **creating the right requirements**. While AI has been successful in some areas, like chess, it struggles in areas like self-driving cars, where there are many variables and rules are based on judgment calls. Similarly, creating and maintaining software is more like driving than playing chess. Technical specifications can help, but too often, developers are handed unclear requirements and wishlists as feature specs. While AI might be able to rewrite existing software, it cannot replace the human ability to define requirements and make judgment calls.* (summary by Readwise Reader)

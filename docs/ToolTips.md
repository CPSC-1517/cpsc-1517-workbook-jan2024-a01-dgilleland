# Know Your Tools ![Docs](https://img.shields.io/badge/Documentation%20Status-%7E10%25%20Minimal%20Outline-lightgrey?logo=Read%20the%20Docs)

> At the core, you really, really need to know how to install software on your computer. If you are struggling with basics such as [**how to install software**](https://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000561.htm), then you had better master the subject - and *fast!* If you can't (or *won't*) learn how to do this *on your own*, then (I know this sounds harsh) you should consider a different career than Information Technology!

> Here are some quick notes on the tools commonly used in this course.

- **VS Code** (*Preferred*)
  - Review the notes on using the [SQL Server extension for Visual Studio Code](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/tools/visual-studio-code/sql-server-develop-use-vscode?view=sql-server-ver16)
  - Review the notes on using the [GitDoc extension](https://github.com/lostintangent/gitdoc#gitdoc-). Also review these instructions on how to turn on [AutoSave in VS Code](https://neutrondev.com/vs-code-auto-save/).

# Uploading Files in Blazor

> *A discussion with **Microsoft Copilot**...*

In Blazor .NET8, I want to have a `<input type="file" accept=".csv" />` to allow the user to upload a text file. How would I process that in the `@code { }` block and save the file to a folder called `RnD` at the root of my project?

![AI](./Images/Copilot-AI.png)

In Blazor .NET 8, you can use the `InputFile` component to handle file uploads. Here's an example of how you can process the uploaded file and save it to a folder named `RnD` at the root of your project:

```csharp
@page "/fileupload"
@using System.IO
@using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Forms

<InputFile OnChange="@OnInputFileChange" accept=".csv" />

@code {
    private async Task OnInputFileChange(InputFileChangeEventArgs e)
    {
        var file = e.File;
        if (file != null)
        {
            var path = Path.Combine(Directory.GetCurrentDirectory(), "RnD", file.Name);
            using var stream = file.OpenReadStream();
            using var fileStream = File.Create(path);
            await stream.CopyToAsync(fileStream);
        }
    }
}
```

This code will create a file input that accepts `.csv` files. When a file is selected, the `OnInputFileChange` method is called. This method reads the file from the input and writes it to the `RnD` directory at the root of your project.

Please note that this code assumes that the `RnD` directory already exists at the root of your project. If it doesn't, you'll need to create it, or add code to create it if it doesn't exist.

Also, be aware that allowing users to upload files to your server can be a security risk. Make sure to validate the contents of the file and handle any errors that might occur during the file upload process. You should also limit the size of the files that can be uploaded to prevent denial-of-service attacks. 

Finally, this code runs on the server in a server-side Blazor application. If you're using a Blazor WebAssembly app, you'll need to send the file to the server using a different method, such as an API call..

What if I want to use the raw `<input type="file">` rather than the `<InputFile>` component? How would I do it that way, or is it even possible?

![AI](./Images/Copilot-AI.png)

In Blazor, it's recommended to use the `<InputFile>` component for handling file uploads because it provides a convenient way to read the file contents and metadata. However, if you want to use the raw `<input type="file">` element, you would need to use JavaScript interop to handle the file upload because Blazor doesn't natively support this.

Here's an example of how you might do this:

```html
<input type="file" id="fileUpload" accept=".csv" onchange="handleFileUpload()" />
<button @onclick="SaveFile">Save File</button>

@code {
    private async Task SaveFile()
    {
        await JS.InvokeVoidAsync("saveFile");
    }
}
```

And in your JavaScript file:

```javascript
let file;

function handleFileUpload() {
    file = document.getElementById('fileUpload').files[0];
}

async function saveFile() {
    const data = new FormData();
    data.append('file', file);

    const response = await fetch('/api/upload', {
        method: 'POST',
        body: data
    });

    if (!response.ok) {
        throw new Error(`Error: ${response.statusText}`);
    }
}
```

In this example, when the file input changes (i.e., a file is selected), the `handleFileUpload` JavaScript function is called, which saves the file to a variable. Then, when the "Save File" button is clicked, the `saveFile` JavaScript function is called, which sends the file to a server-side endpoint (`/api/upload`) using the Fetch API.

This is a simplified example and might not work in your specific situation. You'll need to adjust the code to fit your needs. Also, remember to validate the file on the server side before saving it to prevent security risks. 

Please note that this approach requires writing JavaScript code, which might not be ideal if you're aiming for a pure C# solution. The `<InputFile>` component is the recommended way to handle file uploads in Blazor. It provides a more idiomatic way to handle file uploads in a Blazor application and doesn't require writing any JavaScript code.

For the JavaScript interop, what would the `'/api/upload'` endpoint look like in Blazor? Can you give a complete example?

![AI](./Images/Copilot-AI.png)

Sure, I can provide an example of how you might implement the `'/api/upload'` endpoint in an ASP.NET Core controller. This endpoint will receive the file from the JavaScript function and save it to the `RnD` folder at the root of your project.

Here's an example of what the controller might look like:

```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using System.IO;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

namespace YourNamespace.Controllers
{
    [Route("api/[controller]")]
    [ApiController]
    public class UploadController : ControllerBase
    {
        [HttpPost]
        public async Task<IActionResult> Post()
        {
            var file = Request.Form.Files[0];
            if (file != null && file.Length > 0)
            {
                var path = Path.Combine(Directory.GetCurrentDirectory(), "RnD", file.FileName);
                using var stream = new FileStream(path, FileMode.Create);
                await file.CopyToAsync(stream);
            }

            return Ok();
        }
    }
}
```

This controller defines a POST endpoint at `'/api/upload'`. When a POST request is made to this endpoint, the method `Post()` is called. This method gets the file from the request, checks if the file is not null and if its size is greater than zero, and then saves the file to the `RnD` directory at the root of your project.

Please note that this is a simplified example and might not work in your specific situation. You'll need to adjust the code to fit your needs. Also, remember to validate the file on the server side before saving it to prevent security risks. 

Finally, this code assumes that the `RnD` directory already exists at the root of your project. If it doesn't, you'll need to create it, or add code to create it if it doesn't exist. 

This example also doesn't handle any errors that might occur during the file upload process. In a real-world application, you should add error handling code to this method to handle any potential issues that might occur. 

Also, be aware that allowing users to upload files to your server can be a security risk. Make sure to validate the contents of the file and handle any errors that might occur during the file upload process. You should also limit the size of the files that can be uploaded to prevent denial-of-service attacks.

Does your API Endpoint example work in Blazor .NET8? It appears to be an example for MVC.

![AI](./Images/Copilot-AI.png)

Yes, the API endpoint example I provided can work with a Blazor application in .NET 8. The example is indeed using the MVC pattern, but it's important to note that Blazor applications can coexist and interact with controllers and APIs in the same project.

In a typical Blazor Server or Blazor WebAssembly application, you can have a backend API built with ASP.NET Core MVC or Razor Pages. This backend can provide endpoints that your Blazor application can call using HTTP requests.

So, even though the file upload handling is done in an MVC-style controller, this doesn't prevent it from being used in a Blazor application. The Blazor part of your application would be responsible for the user interface (like rendering the file input and handling the button click), while the MVC part would handle the server-side processing (like receiving the uploaded file and saving it to disk).

Remember to register the `UploadController` in the `Startup.cs` or `Program.cs` (for .NET 6 onwards) file of your project to ensure that the endpoint is available. You can do this by calling `services.AddControllers()` in the `ConfigureServices` method and `endpoints.MapControllers()` in the `Configure` method.

Also, please note that the JavaScript interop and the API endpoint are two separate things. The JavaScript interop is used to handle the file upload on the client side (in the user's browser), while the API endpoint is used to receive the uploaded file on the server side. Both are necessary when using the raw `<input type="file">` element in Blazor. If you use the `<InputFile>` component, you don't need to write any JavaScript code, as the component handles the file upload for you. However, you still need an API endpoint or some server-side code to receive and process the uploaded file. 

I hope this clarifies your question. If you have any more questions, feel free to ask! ðŸ˜Š

Please detail how I would register my `UploadController` in the `Program.cs` using the `services.AddControllers()` and configure the appropriate endpoints. Be specific to the fact that my `Program.cs` is a Top-Level Program and that I am using Blazor with .NET8 written in C# and that I am using the empty Blazor template (no bootstrap). I want you to be specific because I don't want any assumptions about items that might be missing. You should probably specify the namespaces I will need to be using as well.

![AI](./Images/Copilot-AI.png)

Sure, I can help with that. Here's how you can register your `UploadController` in the `Program.cs` file of a top-level program using .NET 8 and Blazor.

First, ensure you have the necessary namespaces at the top of your `Program.cs` file:

```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting;
using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting;
using YourNamespace.Controllers; // replace with your actual namespace
```

Then, in your `Program.cs` file, you can add the `services.AddControllers()` in the `ConfigureServices` method to register your controllers. Here's how you can do it:

```csharp
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// Add services to the container.
builder.Services.AddControllers(); // This will register your controllers
builder.Services.AddRazorPages();

var app = builder.Build();

// Configure the HTTP request pipeline.
if (!app.Environment.IsDevelopment())
{
    app.UseExceptionHandler("/Error");
    app.UseHsts();
}

app.UseHttpsRedirection();
app.UseStaticFiles();

app.UseRouting();

app.MapControllers(); // This will configure the endpoints for your controllers

app.MapBlazorHub();
app.MapFallbackToPage("/_Host");

app.Run();
```

In this code, `services.AddControllers()` registers your controllers, and `app.MapControllers()` configures the endpoints for your controllers.

Please replace `YourNamespace.Controllers` with the actual namespace where your `UploadController` is located. If your `UploadController` is in a different project, make sure to add a reference to that project.

Remember to define your actions in your `UploadController`. The routing will be configured based on the controller's name (`Upload` in this case) and the action methods defined in it.

Can you describe the purpose of the following items in the `Program.cs`?

```csharp
app.MapBlazorHub();
app.MapFallbackToPage("/_Host");
```

![AI](./Images/Copilot-AI.png)

Sure, I can explain those for you:

- `app.MapBlazorHub();`: This line of code maps the SignalR hub that Blazor Server uses to handle real-time client-server communication. The Blazor Server model is based on a SignalR connection being established between the client and the server. This connection is used for almost all UI interactions. When an event occurs on the client, for example, a button click, the information about the event is sent to the server over the SignalR connection.

- `app.MapFallbackToPage("/_Host");`: This line of code sets up a fallback route that maps all failed route requests to the `/_Host` Razor page. This is necessary because Blazor is a client-side library that uses the server only for setting up connections, serving static files, and handling fallback routing. When a request comes in for a route that doesn't correspond to any static file or server-side route, it's necessary to return the `_Host.cshtml` page instead. The Blazor router then takes over and attempts to render a component that matches the requested route.

In the `private async Task SaveFIle()`, I am getting a compilation error because it does not recognize the `JS` for the JavaScript interop. Am I missing a `using` statement?

![AI](./Images/Copilot-AI.png)

Yes, you're correct. The `JS` object is provided by the `IJSRuntime` interface, which allows .NET code to call JavaScript functions from .NET methods. To use it, you need to include the appropriate `using` statement at the top of your file:

```csharp
using Microsoft.JSInterop;
```

Then, you need to inject `IJSRuntime` into your component:

```csharp
@inject IJSRuntime JS;
```

Now, you should be able to use `JS` in your `SaveFile` method. For example:

```csharp
private async Task SaveFile()
{
    await JS.InvokeVoidAsync("yourJavaScriptFunction");
}
```

Remember to replace `"yourJavaScriptFunction"` with the actual JavaScript function you want to call.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions. ðŸ˜Š

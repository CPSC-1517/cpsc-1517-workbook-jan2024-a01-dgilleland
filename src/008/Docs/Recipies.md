# Blazor Form Recipies

Here are some short snippets to show how to work with forms in Blazor. All of these recipies presume the use of the `<EditForm>` component.

## Data Models

We can create a `class` to "model" or represent the data a user would input through a form.

- Using a DTO or POCO for the data model works best, as the public `get`/`set` of the properties and lack of constructors simplifies Blazor's built-in data-binding mechanisms.
- Validation for individual properties in the data model can be done through *validation attributes*

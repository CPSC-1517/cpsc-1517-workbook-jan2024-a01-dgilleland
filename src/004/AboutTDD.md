# Intro to Test-Driven Development

**Test-Driven Development** (*TDD*) is one of the best practices for building software applications. As we work to complete our application, we will make use of TDD practices to guide our application's internal functionality. For this, we will need to have another project as part of our solution: An **XUnit** project.

## Setup

Using the terminal, run the following from inside the `~/src/004` folder.

```ps
dotnet new xunit -o WindChill.Specs -n WindChill.Specs
```

Then, let's add that to our solution.

```ps
dotnet sln add WindChill.Specs/WindChill.Specs.csproj
```

Now, change directory to the testing folder and add in a reference to our WindChill application and a package for a library called `FluentAssertions`.

```ps
cd WindChill.Specs
dotnet add reference ../WindChill/WindChill.csproj
dotnet add package FluentAssertions
```

Open the `GlobalUsings.cs` and modify the code so that it reads as follows.

```cs
global using Xunit;
global using FluentAssertions;
```

## Testing for WindChill

In the [previous document](./ReadMe.md), we decided to create a class to calculate the wind chill temperature. Central to that is the [formula](./WindChill.md):

$$
13.12 + (0.6215 \times T) - 11.37 \times (V^{0.16}) + 0.3965 \times T (V^{0.16})
$$

Let's create a bit of test data to help us check that our math is correct. We'll use the info we gathered from our [Bing AI search results](./ReadMe.md#calculating-the-wind-chill).

> *Grab your calculator and make sure my math is correct here!*

| Air Temp (°C) | Wind Speed (km/h) | Wind Chill |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| -10 | 20 | -17.855 |

### The `WindChill` Class

Parsing the arguments for our wind chill calculations is a little more involved. We could do it inside our TLP, but since the arguments are highly specific to the wind chill calculations, let's just hand-over the arguments to the `WindChill` class through a constructor to let it do the parsing and the construction of the object.

- [ ] Require temperatures to be below freezing.
- [ ] Require wind speeds to be between 0 and 70km/h

### Our Final Calculation


So far, that looks good. But we should remember that the formula is using exponents (e.g.: $T^{0.16}$) and other fractional values (e.g.: $0.6215$). Unless we employ precise rounding at certain points of our calculations, we'll probably get some failed tests. Therefore, we'll use some *aproximations* in our tests.

Learning Outcomes ([**LOGs**](./docs/learning_outcomes/ReadMe.md)) and other useful notes can be found in the [**docs** folder](./docs). Also, you are encouraged to use the [**docs/mynotes**](./docs/mynotes/ReadMe.md) folder to record your notes from each class.

> :warning: **Do *NOT*** use this repository for any assignments that are worth marks. :warning:

Additionally, you can find online notes at the course's [Moodle site](https://moodle.nait.ca).

<!--
> *There are old,  unofficial [website notes](https://cpsc-1517.github.io). These notes are no longer maintained, but may still be useful for some aspects of this course. You should remember that they contain content that references the older .NET Framework which is no longer taught in this course, so don't attempt to blindly apply content into material for the current iteration of this course.*

At the end of the term, your repositories on the [CPSC-1517 GitHub Organization](https://github.com/CPSC-1517) will be removed. You will still have access to your local versions of these repositories for your personal use and review.

> :warning: **Do *NOT*** re-publish your assignment/assessment repositories - doing so with any materials worth marks is an act of academic dishonesty :warning:
